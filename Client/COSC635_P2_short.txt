Abstract

   This document provides sockets Application Program Interface (API) to
   support "advanced" IPv6 applications, as a supplement to a separate
   specification, RFC 3493.  The expected applications include Ping,
   Traceroute, routing daemons and the like, which typically use raw
   sockets to access IPv6 or ICMPv6 header fields.  This document
   proposes some portable interfaces for applications that use raw
   sockets under IPv6.  There are other features of IPv6 that some
   applications will need to access: interface identification
   (specifying the outgoing interface and determining the incoming
   interface), IPv6 extension headers, and path Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU) information.  This document provides API access to these
   features too.  Additionally, some extended interfaces to libraries
   for the "r" commands are defined.  The extension will provide better
   backward compatibility to existing implementations that are not
   IPv6-capable.
